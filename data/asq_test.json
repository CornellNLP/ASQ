[{"narrative": "o there,  As a hobbyist programmer - with a little knowledge and experience in VB6 and VBA - I would like to ask which language is best to try learning in my spare time. My goals are:  1. To learn a language that will last in time, as I am not a professional and do not have the time needed to be always uptodated or to learn many different languages. 2. Also I would like not to be limited in one OS - I run Windows and Linux on my desktop and Androoid on my phone so making an app or program working on at least 2 of them would be great. 3. If there is aposibility to creat web apps-programs that seems nice too. Everything turns into web apps these days so it will be useful. The reasons  I am programming are mostly my sutisfaction and enjoyment of producing a \"properly working\" mechanism and sometimes the needs of my work (civil engineer). My current research points out C++ is a good option but as I have no idea of the existing possibilities I would like you to enlight me and if it is not a bother please include a comment on why you believe your proposal fits my description above.

Last week my in-laws told me that they wanted to send my photos to this person and I told them I wasn't comfortable with that and would get back to them on it. Obviously they did that anyway. I have some anxiety issues and I'm pretty uncomfortable with my picture being out there like that. I'm also not comfortable knowing that somebody has downloaded a Facebook picture of my kid and sent them off to be put in some book somewhere. If I make a big deal out of this my in-laws will cause huge drama as they always do. If I don't do anything my anxiety is going through the roof because having my photos used by others without my control is a big trigger for me. I'm so uncomfortable with the whole situation and I feel violated. One photo taken is the only picture I have up on Facebook of my child.

I decided to change schools this semester and study in a different country (studying in Scotland now) because I think a degree from here would be better than a 3rd world country degree. This is all worked out with my family and fine. The problem comes with subject selection. I ended up taking 4 university application level subjects instead of five, and the subject I should have taken might clash with another one I want, or may not even be there at all. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if I knew what I wanted to study in university. I'm considering engineering and medicine, but i feel medicine needs a bit of passion. I have no great desire to study anything, I just want a stable career and not to end up in a job I hate or stuck in a jobless limbo. For those of you who know a bit more about the Scottish education system, I'm doing higher maths, higher history, higher chemistry, higher English and NAT 5 biology.

He currently worked part time (3 days a week) as a nigh security guard. He lives in his parents basement. He has no ambition to better his situation. To make matters even worse, he is married with one kid. His wife primarily takes care of the kid while he stays up late playing video games and sleeping during the day. I've tried talking to him and he gets so angry. He refuses to recognize his responsibilities and that his actions are affecting others.

Using the property manager as a mediator, we found someone who would be willing to take over our lease for the duration and agreed to surrender our security deposit if we could break lease. He flat out told us \"no.\" Subleasing is also not allowed according to the lease terms.

In all previous years, I've been going to school with some of my best friends at a small charter school. These people are great guys but sadly we went to different high schools and this year I'm really struggling with new friendships. I dress well, am nice to anyone I talk to, girls seem to like me, I take all AP or advanced classes, and don't do any kind of drugs or drink. I take pride in all these things and always act as myself at school, but I've always felt some disconnect between myself and the people around me. I constantly try to make new friends and it seems like all these people just think they're above me. All I really want this year is to find some friends, as I feel that will make my life as happy as it has been in all other years. I just seem to be struggling to find those couple of people that are good people that I like and that like me.

Two years ago I finished my research and math for the drive, but I concluded that while the drive is certainly possible, it may not be practical.

Today, I just read an article about the drive and thought, \"well crap this is awkward.\" This drive likely doesn't interact with \"quantum vacuum virtual plasma\" or whatever the heck that is, but instead it (very inefficiently) takes advantage of the mechanics that i discovered. It actually does not violate conservation of momentum (I have the math and physics to prove it) and it comes with some very mind bending characteristics that would allow for exceptionally inexpensive space launches. I expected that i would be able to quietly hold on to the technology until I was in a position to pursue it.

For the past couple of months my mood has been considerably more negative than normal and, if there's nothing to look forward to, it gets even worse. I feel like I'm going through the motions just trying to make it through the day. Only the next day is full of the same thing. It seems pointless.   Things are better when I'm not alone.

We followed eachother on IG and then it stopped there. Now when he's outside of my work he doesn't talk much but still nice. He's outside almost every weekend. He leaves for Africa soon and isn't originally from here (just here for the volunteer org we have) so he might not.be back afterwards just seems like I can't make anything move towards a friendship lol   I live in a small town.

The past year hasnt been the best for us losing our grandma and our family falling apart. My dad is selling the house that he inherited from our grandmas death which we lived in and he wants nothing to do with us anymore. We have a month to find somewhere else to live and my dad agreed to use a portion of the money to get us into an affordable rental to stay afloat while he moves in with someone. My brother and I are both good kids that did well in school, graduated, played sports, and dont do drugs. We have found a few rental options in our area but my only worry is getting into a rental agreement. My brother has a job and drives but I was never able to get a job these past months. Even though my brother has been working for months now and we can pay for 6 months worth of rent straight away on most of our options.

You can say no to her but feel bad for her since you know it is an opportunity for her and if you say no she will remain somewhere for the rest of her life where women are treated as s. But she will probably live with parents which is better for them since they will have something to fall back to and wont have to pay for her living expense.

Thank you Reddit for helping me take care of my friend. Over the weekend my friend got very drunk and fell down the stairs. He was taken to the hospital and allowed to sober up but refused to let them start an IV or do a scan of his head to check for bleeding. He did allow them to take an X-ray of his nose/face to make sure he didn't have any facial fractures. He has some swelling on the back of his head and around his nose. I am concerned because he has been complaining of a headache tonight. This injury occurred last night. He is of course sober now. I told him if the headaches continue on to tomorrow or the next day he should consider going to a doctor.
